1.Reflect on the differences between static and interactive visualizations.

A static chart just shows the data without letting you do anything with it, 
while interactive charts let you click, zoom, or filter to explore the information. 
This makes it easier to notice patterns or details that might not be obvious in a simple picture.

2.Write a short paragraph discussing the advantages of using dashboards for real-time data exploration.

Dashboards are helpful because they show lots of charts and numbers all together, 
and they can update automatically. This helps people quickly see whatâ€™s happening 
and make decisions using the latest information.

3.Explain how interactive tools like Plotly and Dash can improve data communication in professional settings.

Tools like Plotly and Dash make it easier to share data because people can interact with the charts themselves. 
This helps teams understand complicated information better and makes presentations more engaging.
